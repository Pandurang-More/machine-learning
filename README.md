# üöÄ ML + Cybersecurity Learning Roadmap (14 Weeks)

This repo contains my personal 14-week roadmap for learning **Machine Learning** + **Cybersecurity projects** (IDS, anomaly detection, fraud, phishing).  
The plan is divided into **3 phases**: Foundations ‚Üí Main Project ‚Üí Enhancement & Resume Prep.
